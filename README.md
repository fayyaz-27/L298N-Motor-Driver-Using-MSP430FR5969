# L298N Motor Driver with MSP430FR5969

## Overview
This project demonstrates controlling **two DC motors** using the **L298N motor driver (12V)** with the **MSP430FR5969 LaunchPad**.  
The motors are driven by toggling the `IN1â€“IN4` pins connected to the MSP430 GPIOs.


- Ensure **common ground** between MSP430 and L298N.  
- Use a **12V power supply** for motors and **5V logic** for MSP430 compatibility.
